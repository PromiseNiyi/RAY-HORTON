                    Just a kid from Tacoma, Washington.

                    Ray started his wealth building journey as a child by 
                    delivering newspapers at 6 in the morning and then later in 
                    life at the age of 15, as a dishwasher in a chinese restaurant 
                    after school until 11 p.m., then walking the 2 miles home.

                    He is known as the first college student athlete to attend 
                    college 8 months before his graduating high school class at the 
                    University of Washington. After graduating from the U.W., Ray was 
                    the first Husky from the class of 1983 to be draft by the Cincinnati 
                    Bengals in the 1983 NFL draft. He finished his 10 year NFL career as a 
                    player with the Dallas Cowboys, going out as Super Bowl XXVII Champion.
